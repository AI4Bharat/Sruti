This repository contains the resources, dataset information, and code for the Interspeech 2025 paper: "Recognizing Every Voice: Towards Inclusive ASR for Rural Bhojpuri Women." Our work focuses on creating the **SRUTI benchmark** for rural Bhojpuri women and leveraging synthetic speech to improve ASR performance for this underserved demographic.

**Paper Abstract:**
Digital inclusion remains a challenge for marginalized communities, especially rural women in low-resource language regions like Bhojpuri. Voice-based access to agricultural services, financial transactions, government schemes, and healthcare is vital for their empowerment, yet existing ASR systems for this group remain largely untested. To address this gap, we create SRUTI, a benchmark consisting of rural Bhojpuri women speakers. Evaluation of current ASR models on SRUTI shows poor performance due to data scarcity, which is difficult to overcome due to social and cultural barriers that hinder large-scale data collection. To overcome this, we propose generating synthetic speech using just 25‚Äì30 seconds of audio per speaker from approximately 100 rural women. Augmenting existing datasets with this synthetic data achieves an improvement of 4.7 WER, providing a scalable, minimally intrusive solution to enhance ASR and promote digital inclusion in low-resource language.
